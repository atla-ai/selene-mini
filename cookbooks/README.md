This example gets you started running evals with absolute scores, and does so on a sample set from the public benchmark [FLASK](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.10928) dataset - a collection of **1,740 human-annotated samples from 120 NLP datasets**. 

# Hallucination Scoring Tutorial

This example gets you started detecting hallucinations, and runs over a sample set from the public benchmark [RAGTruth](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00396) benchmark - a large-scale corpus of naturally generated hallucinations, featuring detailed word-level annotations specifically designed for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) scenarios.
